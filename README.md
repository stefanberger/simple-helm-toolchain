# ![Icon](./.bluemix/secure-lock-helm.png) Develop a Kubernetes app with Helm


### Continuously deliver a secure Docker app to a Kubernetes Cluster using a Helm Chart
This Hello World application uses Docker and Kubernetes Helm in a DevOps toolchain preconfigured for 
continuous delivery to a Kubernetes cluster. It automates numerous tasks such automatic triggering from Git
commits, issue tracking, online editing, automatic linting of files, configuration of target cluster permissions to private image registry, etc... through a preconfigured Delivery Pipeline.

### Use it with your own application:
This template assumes an application (e.g. [hello-helm](https://github.com/stefanberger/simple-helm-toolchain)) structured like this  :
- `/Dockerfile` [must] -- the docker file used to build the container image in root folder
- `/chart /your-app-name`  [must] -- the Helm Chart used to deploy this application. The CI pipeline automatically binding it with build information (e.g. image tag) leveraging Helm ability to parameterize deployment actions.

It implements the following best practices:
- sanity check the Dockerfile prior to attempting creating the image,
- build container image on every Git commit,
- use a private image registry to store the built image, automatically configure access permissions for target cluster deployment using API tokens than can be revoked,
- check container image for security vulnerabilities,
- use a Helm chart to conduct the deployment of each release, abstracting away continuous integration via Helm command parameters,
- use an explicit namespace in cluster to insulate each deployment (and make it easy to clear, by "kubectl delete namespace").
